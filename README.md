# Challenge 1

## Front (3 cubes):
- For the front of the house, we used three 3D cubes to make up the front. Two of the cubes were used for the sides, leaving a space between each acting as a door. The third and final cube, we adjusted it at the top of the other two cubes and made it longer so that it connects the first two cubes accordingly,  leaving us with the first wall of the house completed. This 3-cube plan make it easy to have that small gap you need for your door.

  #### Parameters of the first two cubes:
  
  - Note: the other cube is the same exact coordinates except the x-position is the opposite, to achive symmetry and have the door centered in the middle of the wall.

## Walls (3 cubes):
- For the rest of the house (the side walls and the back), we used three cubes with the exact same scale parameters(x,y,z) for symmetry all around. For the side walls, we adjusted the y-rotation of the cubes to 90º degrees to get the 3D effect in motion. For the position, we adjusted them to fit accordingly to the first wall we made first.

  #### Parameters of the two cubes for the walls:
   - Tip: the positions for both cubes at the sides use the exact same vales except the x-position. Just adjust one of the cube's x-position to the negative/positive number you have set of the other cube.

- For the wall of the back of the house, we used one single cube and kept the rotation as normal (0º degrees). We positioned it to connect both walls giving us our base for our house finally complete.
