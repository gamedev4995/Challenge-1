# Challenge 1

_Front of the house:_
- We used three cubes to make up the first wall of the house, two larger cubes at the edges and one longer cube for the top to create the door of the house

  Parameters of the cubes to the sides. 
  - The other cube is the same exact coordinates except the x-position is the opposite for symmetry.

_Walls:_
- We used three cubes with the exact same scale parameters(x,y,z) for symmetry but adjusted the y-rotation to 90ยบ for the sides of the house. The back of the house went back to 0ยบ.
