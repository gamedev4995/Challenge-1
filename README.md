# Challenge 1

## Front (3 cubes):
- For the front of the house, we used three 3D cubes to make up the front. Two of the cubes were used for the sides, leaving a space between each acting as a door. The third and final cube, we adjusted it at the top of the other two cubes and made it longer so that it connects the first two cubes accordingly,  leaving us with the first wall of the house completed. This 3-cube plan make it easy to have that small gap you need for your door.

  #### Parameters of the first two cubes:
  
  - Note: the other cube is the same exact coordinates except the x-position is the opposite, to achive symmetry and have the door centered in the middle of the wall.

  #### Parameters of the longer cube at the top:

## Walls (3 cubes):
- For the rest of the house (the side walls and the back), we used three cubes with the exact same scale parameters(x,y,z) for symmetry all around. For the side walls, we adjusted the y-rotation of the cubes to 90º degrees to get the 3D effect in motion. For the position, we adjusted them to fit accordingly to the first wall we made first.

  #### Parameters of the two cubes for the walls:
   - Tip: the positions for both cubes at the sides use the exact same vales except the x-position. Just adjust one of the cube's x-position to the negative/positive number you have set of the other cube.

- For the wall of the back of the house, we used one single cube and kept the rotation as normal (0º degrees). We positioned it to connect both walls giving us our base for our house finally complete.

## Roof (2 cubes):
- For the roof of the house, we first placed a 3D cube and adjusted it's sides to make a rectangle long enough to create an overhang.

- Then we rotated it from from the z axis at an angle of our preference as the right side for the gable roof style and lowered it down so that it connects with the wall of the house.

  #### Parameters of the cube for the right side of the roof:

- For the other side, we duplicated the right side of the roof and changed the x and z coordinates to it's opposite values for symmetry.

  #### Parameters of the cube for the left side of the roof:

- Depending on the size chosen for the cubes, adjustments to the scale of each cube might be needed, as it occurred in our case, where the roof was left with a gap. So, we extended them as needed to the point where they perfectly intersect in the middle of the house without any visible gaps or overlaps. Which left us with the final version of the gable roof house!

## Experiences Gained:
- For me, this experience on our first project together was fun and exciting. At first, we went through a few hardships like making sure everything was running for the three of us correctly to combating errors the project was giving us. It was a simple task in my opinion yet exciting to finally be able to create something and work with my group at the same time; getting excited when we could see each other's adjustments on our own computers. I've never worked with Unity before, so the whole process for me was very interesting and educative, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Within time during the semester, I know it will get even more interesting and challenging, but I'm excited to learn the new features and skills of Unity ahead of us.

- Although we had a rough start with some errors that would ocurr, we eventually were able to overcome them with the help of other classmates, which provided us with new knowledge on how to deal with future errors, if any. In regards to the assignment itself, it was fun being able to create something more concrete rather than abstract, despite being pretty simple. I also enjoyed being able to work with my other teamates on the same project as this allowed us to begin developing a good team dynamic and communication for the more difficult proyects that lie ahead of us. I've always wanted to learn a bit on game engines, and so far, I've been trully loving the experience.
